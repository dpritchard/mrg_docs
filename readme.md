# mrg_docs
This is the documentation for the [MRG MATLAB toolbox][mrg]. The contents of this repository are probably best browsed directly at the [MRG toolbox documentation pages][mrg_docs].  

The documentation itself is generated dynamically from the code using the brilliant [m2html][m2html] toolbox by Guillaume Flandin. It is hosted here in a separate repository (not in an orphaned `gh-pages` branch, like GitHub [recommends][ghpagedocs]) because MATLAB insists on locking files (on Windows), which makes branch-switching in git a real pain.
